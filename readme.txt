Project Idea: Task Management System

This project will be a basic task management system where users can create tasks, assign them to other users, and manage the tasks' status. We'll use Django's built-in authentication system along with groups and permissions to manage access control.

Features:

    User Authentication:
        Users can register, login, and logout.
        User profiles with basic information (e.g., name, email) will be available.

    Task Management:
        Users can create new tasks with details like title, description, priority, and due date.
        Tasks can be assigned to other users.
        Users can view all tasks assigned to them.
        Tasks can have different statuses (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).

    Access Control:
        Define groups such as "Managers", "Team Leads", and "Employees".
        Assign permissions to groups based on roles. For example:
            Managers: Can create, edit, and delete tasks. Can assign tasks to any user.
            Team Leads: Can create, edit, and delete tasks. Can assign tasks only to their team members.
            Employees: Can view tasks assigned to them and update the status of their tasks.

    User Interface:
        Use Django's admin interface for managing users, groups, and permissions.
        Implement user-friendly interfaces for creating, editing, and viewing tasks.

Project Setup:

    Create a Django project using django-admin startproject project_name.
    Define models for users, tasks, and any other necessary entities.
    Set up Django's built-in authentication system (django.contrib.auth).
    Define groups and assign permissions to them using Django's admin interface or programmatically.
    Implement views, templates, and forms for user registration, login, task management, etc.
    Ensure proper access control based on user roles and permissions.
    Test the application thoroughly to ensure that users can perform actions according to their assigned roles and permissions.

By implementing this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to use Django's user, group, and permission concepts effectively in a real-world scenario. Additionally, you'll learn how to design and implement access control mechanisms to secure your Django applications.
